## Project Vision

A biometric authentication app for COMP3000 

This GitHub repository stores the three different applications that make up the biometric authentication password manager.

The website, made is React JS, allows users to store and create passwords on the server, storing them to be able to be retrieved by the mobile application.
The mobile application, stores all requets made on that account for up to three minutes per request, the user can accept or deny the request to provide the requested password.
The extension works similar to the website, the user can request a password if the website the user is currently on is stored in the server.

The main goal of this project was to complete a project lifecycle of a full-stack development project while focusing on security by design.
